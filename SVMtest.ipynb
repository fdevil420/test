            "Yesterday, for the first time since 2006, Russia failed to be re-elected for a spot on the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) - which until July was chaired by none other than Saudi Arabia - after being narrowly beaten by Croatia in a vote. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia was successfully re-elected, despite vocal criticism from human rights organizations. The 47 places on the council are distributed on a regional basis, with staggered elections seeing a third of the body re-elected each year. Russia had finished its three-year term, and was running against Hungary and Croatia for the two available seats from Eastern Europe. \n",
            "The decision was close, and came down to just two votes: with Hungary far ahead, Croatia received the votes of 114 of the 193 member countries, and Russia was selected on 112 ballots. \n",
            "\"It was a very close vote and very good countries competing, Croatia, Hungary. They are fortunate because of their size, they are not exposed to the winds of international diplomacy. Russia is very exposed. We've been in the UNHRC for several years, and I am sure next time we will stand and get back in,\" Russia's UN envoy Vitaly Churkin said quoted by RT . Russia is eligible to run next year, against a new set of countries. \n",
            "Ahead of this yearâ€™s vote Russia came under concerted pressure from human rights organizations. â€œThe non-election of Russia shows that the nations of the world can reject gross abusers if they so choose,â€ said executive director Hillel Neuer. â€œThis makes the election of Saudi Arabia, China and Cuba even more preposterous.â€ \n",
            "As we reported earlier this week , a petition signed by 80 NGOs, including Human Rights Watch and Refugees International, asked the voting countries to \"question seriously whether Russia's role in Syria which includes supporting and undertaking military actions which have routinely targeted civilians and civilian objects renders it fit to serve on the UN's premier inter-governmental human rights institution.\" Russia dismissed the petition, published this week, as â€œcynicalâ€ and â€œdishonorable,â€ and said the accusations were motivated more by politics than by concern for human rights. Moscow, which has been conducting airstrikes in the country over the past year, says that it is acting legally, following an official call for assistance from the Syrian government, and insists that its war efforts are targeted at terrorists. \n",
            "However, most perversely, in what was clearly a politically-motivated choice, Saudi Arabia sailed through the Asian regional ballot with 152 votes, and will sit on the UNHRC alongside China, Japan and Iraq for the next three years.        0.00      0.00      0.00         1\n",

They spent a lot of money and personal resources to help Hillary Clinton out during the election, but not any more says CEO and Founder Mark Zuckerberg! After the liberal media tried to make him turn on one of his oldest friends, Peter Thiel, for donating to Donald Trump , Zuckerberg finally decided to fight back. Since Zuckerberg is still technically supporting Hillary for President, in the following video I suggest what his real motive may have been for lashing out with pro-Trump rhetoric, and why the person heâ€™s defending doesnâ€™t win Zuckerberg any humanitarian awards eitherâ€¦ He wrote a scathing post, telling people that Facebook will stand for more than just the ideas of a few tech elite, but instead for the ideas of the people. Zuckerberg even acknowledged there are GOOD reasons that people support Trump : They believe strongly in smaller government They want a different tax policy They want a better health care system They want to maintain religious freedom They worry about American gun rights Or ANY other issue where he disagrees with Hillary He ended the post by saying: â€œThatâ€™s ultimately what Facebook is about: giving everyone the power to share our experiences, so we can understand each other a bit better and connect us a little closer together.â€ So, despite the fact that he still supports Hillary Clinton , I want to thank Mark Zuckerberg for having the common decency to acknowledge the Trump Train even though all his tech billionaire friends will attack him for it. Now letâ€™s get this shared out everywhere so we can show the world that Hillaryâ€™s â€œnetworkâ€ is finally turning itâ€™s back on her. In related news, could what happened just hours after the final debate be the REAL reason Zuckerberg came out of the closet as a pro-Trump keyboard warrior? Several hours after what was arguably Trump â€™s best performance of the campaign so far, one of the worldâ€™s top political experts gave Trump the best news he could hope to hearâ€¦ Danny Gold continues: If you love Trump , today just became a HECK of a lot better! A very well respected political professor from Syracuse has just given Donald Trump the best news of the entire election. Professor Helmut Norpoth stepped forward today, despite HUGE opposition from his peers, to announce that his scientific formula has predicted the TRUE results of the election. And the result isâ€¦ There is an 87%-99% chance that Donald Trump will WIN the election! Heck yeah! See, at least there are still some people who have not been bought off by Hillary Clinton. According to Northrop, all the other predictions are based entirely on opinion polls, which are inherently wrong. Instead of opinion polling, Norpoth relies on statistics from candidatesâ€™ performances in party primaries and patterns in the electoral cycle to forecast results. His model has correctly predicted the victor in every presidential election since 1996. (H/T- The Gateway Pundit ) So if you wanted something to celebrate, I mean other than Donald Trump â€™s epic win over Hillary Clinton at the final Presidential debate, then Helmut Norpoth has just given you exactly that. Now letâ€™s help share this GREAT news to everyone else in the entire world. Let every Trump supporting Facebook friend you have know! First of all, Zuckerberg may be a flaming liberal, but heâ€™s no fool. Itâ€™s no secret that Zuckerberg has enjoyed a cushy relationship with Obama and the White House over the past eight years, but a Trump presidency could pose a threat to Mark Zuckerbergâ€™s current role as the self-proclaimed arbiter of â€œfree speech.â€ As Facebookâ€™s CEO, Zuckerberg has almost absolute control over what is, and what is not â€œacceptableâ€ to believe in, or talk about on the Internet. Then, thereâ€™s the whole issue of who Zuckerberg was defending when he had his micro-aggression and temporarily boarded the â€œ Trump Train.â€ Itâ€™s not like he was defending Mother Teresaâ€™s good name or something. Peter Thiel, the guy who is Zuckâ€™s BFF that people were ragging on for donating to Trump , just happens to the chief henchman of the Bilderberg Group, and chairman of its steering committee. Itâ€™s worth noting too, that Peter Thiel is HARDLY Zuckerbergâ€™s closest connection to the Bilderberg group. I wonâ€™t discuss it here, but heâ€™s got another connection that hits MUCH closer to home, so before everyone gets all excited thinking that perhaps Zuckerberg isnâ€™t such a bad guy after all, itâ€™s more likely heâ€™s just hedging his bets, and Hillary was probably fully aware of what he said ahead of time.

            "As Election Day approaches, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton knows that she must be able to count on the votes of the black community, a bloc that has been a reliable Democratic constituency for decades. \n",
            "In light of some of the revelations in the WikiLeaks e-mail dump, the Clinton campaign is worried that they may actually have a fight on their hands on Tuesday for the support of African Americans. \n",
            "Even President Obama senses the danger. \n",
            "In an article covering a campaign stop in North Carolina made by the current Oval Office occupant, CBS News reported on November 3 that Obama \"worries now the black vote 'is not as solid as it needs to be' for Hillary Clinton.\" \n",
            "His fears may be well-founded. Here's the situation as reported by CBS News: An Associated Press analysis of early voting data in North Carolina shows blacks have cast 111,000 fewer ballots than at this point four years ago, when Obama lost the state by about 92,000 votes. Clinton aides note that GOP officials there reduced early voting sites for the initial week of early voting, and they say they can make up the difference by Election Day now that more sites are opening. Black votersâ€™ share of early ballots request is also down a few percentage points in Florida and Ohio, though the Clinton campaign points to strong early turnout in key urban counties with large numbers of blacks and Hispanics. \n",
            "It's not as if Hillary Clinton is just sitting back, trusting that blacks will show up for her on Election Day. She's attacking her Republican opponent, Donald Trump, calling him a threat to the black community. Again, from CBS News: Her [Hillary Clinton's] campaign is broadcasting an ad on black-audience radio stations hailing the former secretary of state as â€œfighting for us,â€ in contrast to Trump â€œdemeaning our community.â€ A female voice in the ad says, â€œListen to how he talks about us.â€ One audio clip has Trump singling out a black supporter at a rally in California: â€œLook at my African-American over here,â€ he said. In another, Trump lambasted Obama as â€œthe most ignorant president in our history.â€ \n",
            "There is evidence, however, that some black voters are focused less on what Trump said about President Obama in a stump speech and more on what Clinton said about African Americans when she thought no one was listening. \n",
            "Black Conservatives Fund (BCF), a non-profit organization dedicated to representing the views of center-right African American voters, just launched a targeted paid media campaign intended to reach minority millennial voters in swing states who are still considering the qualities of the two major party candidates running for the White House. \n",
            "Their advertising features two spots highlighting Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clintonâ€™s previous comments expressing contempt for black Americans, calling them â€œsuper-predatorsâ€ and claiming theyâ€™d make up her â€œfirewallâ€ against Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in the 2016 primary. \n",
            "The ad, â€œHillary Hates,â€ features the candidateâ€™s 1996 comments where she was caught using racially divisive undertones to champion a bill that ultimately locked up a generation of black men. The ad also uses 2016 footage of her run-ins with Black Lives Matter protesters. â€œWeâ€™re not just the only conservative group going after black voters on television â€” weâ€™re the only group, period,â€ Black Conservatives Fund Senior Adviser Ali Akbar said. \n",
            "With a television buy in Ohio and North Carolina, the ad is supplemented by a sizable digital buy that spans across Facebook, Instagram, and smaller, highly targeted web publications. The cable time has been reserved across BET, CNN, ESPN, HGTV, and USA networks in these states. \n",
            "The digital ad buy stretches into at least three other states not being targeted on television. In total, the group has planned a six-figure commitment to their advertising campaign for the remainder of the 2016 general election, hoping to move the needle away from a candidate who, when the election isn't days away, uses language to describe black voters that would cause substantial media furor if such statements were made by a Republican presidential hopeful. \n",
            "â€œMake no mistake: our aim isnâ€™t to suppress African American votes. Instead, weâ€™re telling black voters to make sure they participate in this election, but they need to remember what Hillary Clinton thinks of them,â€ Akbar said. â€œWe are confident that our message will have significant reach, since Democrats have neglected advertising to them this cycle.â€ \n",
            "Akbar's message might be reaching the right homes, as even the New York Times has reported that early voting among blacks is down in key states and that this electoral anomaly might turn out to be \"canary in a coal mine\" indicating that black voters aren't as monolithic or as easily duped as the Clinton campaign and the DNC thinks they are. From the Times article published on November 1: African-Americans are failing to vote at the robust levels they did four years ago in several states that could help decide the presidential election, creating a vexing problem for Hillary Clinton as she clings to a deteriorating lead over Donald J. Trump with Election Day just a week away. As tens of millions of Americans cast ballots in what will be the largest-ever mobilization of early voters in a presidential election, the numbers have started to point toward a slump that many Democrats feared might materialize without the nationâ€™s first black president on the ticket. \n",
            "For its part, the BCF has not been a backer of Trump from the beginning. In fact, during the primary campaign, the group endorsed, contributed to, and made independent expenditures for Dr. Ben Carson and then Senator Ted Cruz. \n",
            "Subsequently, BCF focused on down-ballot races and driving Hillary Clintonâ€™s negatives higher with black voters. The PAC has been recognized by outlets such as National Review for being one of the most efficient grassroots PACs. \n",
            "â€œOnce every four years the black community is courted then subsequently abandoned by Hillary Clinton Democrats,â€ Akbar concluded. â€œAmid numerous protests by black millennials against Hillary Clintonâ€™s candidacy, the black vote was again taken for granted. No more.â€ \n",
            "Despite the valiant efforts of the BCF and other constitutionally minded, liberty-loving black voters, it is almost certain that Hillary Clinton will run away with the black vote by a substantial margin. \n",
            "That isn't the issue, though. The issue is that we may be witnessing the early days of a generational shift by the African American community away from being a Democratic Party \"fire wall\" â€” as Clinton dismissively declared them â€” and toward being a voting bloc that doesn't turn a blind eye to the disrespectful and dismissive way it has been treated by a Democratic Party that does little to improve the quality of life of this important and politically powerful minority.         0.00      0.00      0.00         1\n",

            "Is Barack Obama about to make the most catastrophic decision of his entire presidency? Former UN Ambassador John Bolton is warning that there is â€œa lot of speculationâ€ over at UN headquarters right now about â€œresolutions that recognize a Palestinian state or that try and set a boundary for Israel based on the 1967 ceasefire linesâ€. Of course this would have to happen before the inauguration of Donald Trump on January 20th , because Trump has already made it quite clear that he will not support any UN resolution of such nature. Knowing that Trump is about to take office, advocates of the â€œtwo state solutionâ€ are putting an immense amount of pressure on Obama to support a UN Security Council resolution that would permanently divide the land of Israel while he is still in the White House, and at this moment we do not know what Barack Obamaâ€™s final decision will be. \n",
            "Most Americans have no idea that this drama is playing out behind the scenes, but those in the know are very much aware of what is happening. The Wall Street Journal recently published an article entitled â€œ Obamaâ€™s Israel Surprise? â€ that discussed the possibility of Obama supporting a UN Security Council resolution that would permanently divide the land of Israel, and the New York Times editorial board has formally endorsed such a resolution. \n",
            "The rest of the UN Security Council is ready to agree to such a resolution, and at this point the only obstacle is getting Barack Obamaâ€™s approval. That is why it was so exceedingly alarming to wake up on Sunday morning and read former UN Ambassador John Boltonâ€™s very chilling warning about what could soon happen at the UN. The following comes from an article on the website of The Hill â€¦ \n",
            "Former United Nations Ambassador John Bolton warned Sunday that President Obama should not take any actions before leaving office that could hurt Israel at the U.N. \n",
            "Bolton said during an interview with radio host John Catsimatidis that there is â€œa lot of speculation over in Turtle Bay at U.N. headquarters about resolutions that recognize a Palestinian state or that try and set a boundary for Israel based on the 1967 ceasefire lines.â€ \n",
            "â€œI think thatâ€™d be very inadvisable for the president to do that,â€ he said. \n",
            "John Bolton is still very tied in to the international community, and Donald Trump is reportedly actively considering asking him to serve as Secretary of State. \n",
            "Needless to say, I would take what he is saying very, very seriously. \n",
            "So what would this potential UN Security Council resolution look like? \n",
            "Well, it would likely accomplish three historic thingsâ€¦ \n",
            "1. It would give formal UN Security Council recognition to a Palestinian state for the very first time. \n",
            "2. It would grant East Jerusalem to the Palestinians as the capital of their new state. \n",
            "3. It would establish the 1967 ceasefire lines as the basis for final negotiations for borders between the two states. \n",
            "Up until now, the U.S. governmentâ€™s veto power on the UN Security Council has always blocked anti-Israel resolutions from passing, but earlier this year the Obama administration said that such a â€œparameters resolutionâ€ was now â€œon the tableâ€. \n",
            "And at this point we still donâ€™t know what Obama is going to ultimately decide, but the Trump transition team is so concerned about this that they recently warned Obama â€œagainst making moves on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in his last months in officeâ€ . \n",
            "But no matter how much they object, the truth is that Trump and his team cannot actually do anything to stop Obama. \n",
            "If Obama decides to betray Israel at the UN, it is going to happen. \n",
            "And of course the Israeli government is extremely concerned about what might take place as well. According to the New York Post , the Israelis asked Secretary of State John Kerry if the Obama administration would promise to veto any anti-Israel resolutions at the UN for the remainder of Obamaâ€™s term, and Kerry flatly refused to make such a promiseâ€¦ \n",
            "Israel faces a unique window of danger from Nov. 9 to Jan. 20: What might President Obama do in his final days in office to slam the Jewish state? \n",
            "Start with Secretary of State John Kerryâ€™s recent flat refusal to promise a US veto on any upcoming anti-Israel resolution in the UN Security Council . \n",
            "On Saturday, Haaretz reports, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told Kerry heâ€™s counting on Washington to stick to its policy of nixing anti-Israel resolutions. Kerryâ€™s reply: The administration has yet to make a decision on the matter . \n",
            "Perhaps equally as alarming is what Obama told the Palestinians. In October, Obama reportedly told them to wait until after the election for any action at the UN Security Councilâ€¦ \n",
            "On the surface, the latest message to the Palestinian Authority from the Obama administration is no different from the past two decades of American policy: the U.S. will veto any resolution attacking Israel or demanding Palestinian independence without them first making peace with the Jewish state. But, as Haaretz reported , there was one significant caveat to the warning. They were told not to push for any such resolution until after the presidential election next month . \n",
            "So why would it be so catastrophic if Obama decides to support a UN Security Council resolution that permanently divides the land of Israel? \n",
            "Well, John Kilpatrick, Shane Warren, Bob Jones and many others have warned that when we divide the land of Israel, our land will be divided too. \n",
            "Whether it is Barack Obama, Donald Trump or some other president that does it, someday this will happen. \n",
            "And when this happens, the floodgates will open and judgment after judgment will hit this nation. I have warned about many of these events in my latest book , and I hope to write much more about what is coming in the months ahead. \n",
            "So right now we are in â€œthe danger zoneâ€ until January 20th, 2017. \n",
            "If we can get to January 20th and Donald Trump is peacefully inaugurated and the land of Israel has not been divided, perhaps we can all breathe a little bit easier for a while. \n",
            "But if the land of Israel is divided between now and then, the consequences for this nation are going to be more severe than most people would dare to imagine.

The south was almost completely gone and all of east Texas from Dallas East and Louisiana was completely gone except a few islands there and in parts of east Texas where there was higher ground. I donâ€™t know if those dreams and visions were from the president betraying Israel but it was something they saw.

Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, but youâ€™d never know it given the ridiculous display by the Obamas on the campaign trail. Fortunately, a pro-Donald Trump super PAC decided to remind Americaâ€¦ and Hillary Clinton is not too happy about it. \n",

            "The Clinton campaign has sent cease and desist letters to at least four local television stations in Florida demanding they stop running an ad paid for by a pro-Trump Super PAC featuring First Lady Michelle Obama â€” even as the PAC is expanding its ad campaign in North Carolina. \n",

Hillaryâ€™s own campaign said when Michelle Obama speaks out, â€œit has a real impact,â€ and indeed, we agree â€“ because it was Mrs. Obama who correctly pointed out Hillary Clinton â€œcertainly canâ€™t run the White House.â€ \n",

            "Part of the problem with Democrats is that they have the media in the tank for them, so they donâ€™t have to own up to anything. Besides, itâ€™s not like their moral compass, the ones that actually have one, would force them to do so. \n",

reasons Towns across Sweden have banned Christmas street lights in the name of â€œsecurity,â€ but the real reason is almost certainly because the country has completely capitulated to Islam after importing countless Muslim migrants over the last two years. According to an SVT report, The Swedish Transport Administration (Trafikverket) will not allow municipalities to erect Christmas street lights on light poles that the authority manages, meaning that many towns will have no festival lights at all on major streets. According to Speisa , â€œThe change is a victory for those who want to tone down the reminder of the countryâ€™s Christian traditions, but according to the Swedish Transport Administration, the decision for the drastic change is â€œsecurityâ€. â€œPoles are not designed for the weight of Christmas lights, and we have to remove anything that should not be there,â€ said Eilin Isaksson, national coordinator at the Swedish Transport Administration. The argument that the lights are too heavy and pose a safety risk sounds like complete baloney. Swedes are being asked to believe that lights normally held up by tree branches are now too weighty to be supported by metal poles. Despite there being no safety issue with the street lights for decades, this new rule has been instituted right after record numbers of Muslim migrants flooded into the country â€“ just a coincidence Iâ€™m sure. In reality, the Christmas lights ban is almost certainly an effort to avoid offending Muslim migrants who are causing chaos in cities like Malmo , where the firebombing of cars and businesses in or near Muslim ghetto â€˜no-go areasâ€™ is becoming a routine occurrence. As we previously reported , a top Swedish Bishop advocated removing crosses from a Christian church and replacing them with Islamic symbols in order to please Muslims. Last Christmas, it was also announced that a Christmas Eve special broadcast on public television would be hosted by a Muslim woman. Some areas of Sweden are even capitulating to returning ISIS terrorists by offering jihadists free driving licenses and housing benefits to help them â€œreintegrate into the job marketâ€.       0.00      0.00      0.00         1\n",

This can sometimes be a torturous realization for me as I contemplate eating something that I know will not serve my body, mind, and spirit well. But if only it were that simple â€” merely having to decide between a cookie or a piece of fruit, rather than trying to understand how their ingredients may help or harm me. advertisement - learn more Labels in particular are one giant headache, but they can also make a world of difference between choosing a good food and a bad one. Labels on the majority of packaged foods need to meet strict requirements, relaying important information for people with food allergies, exposing food additives, and offering food storage instructions. But with the plethora of food labels out there, how can one keep up? Itâ€™s not even a matter of whether you can or not, or even want to or not; you simply need to know what you are putting in your body. We all shop for food, and as we do, whether it be online or in the store, we come across so many ingredients, brands, and ultimately, labels. Thereâ€™s â€œcage freeâ€ and â€œhumane certification,â€ thereâ€™s â€œnaturalâ€and â€œno antibiotics,â€ and then thereâ€™s â€œorganic.â€ All of these labels can tell you important information about how animals are fed and handled, how crops are grown, and even how the workers are treated. They say ignorance is bliss, but when it comes to your health and humanity, the saying doesnâ€™t always hold up. Have you ever seen a video online, listened to a descriptive story, or watched a full-length documentary about the way our food is made and by whom, and been utterly turned off, disgusted, or even beside yourself with anxiety and sadness? Thereâ€™s a reason such exposures exist: to make people wake up and realize that the system isnâ€™t as cut and dry as healthy and unhealthy. So when it comes to labels, while it can seem like far too much information to comprehend, it remains our duty to ourselves and to our families to learn what each signifies. And it doesnâ€™t even have to be that difficult. advertisement - learn more Ghergich & Co. teamed up with Woodside to create an infographic on food labels in the hopes that they could easily share a go-to guide for consumers to understand exactly what the labels on the food theyâ€™re considering buying mean. They cover terms like cage free, certified humane, free range, free roaming, grass fed, and wild caught. Certified Fair Trade products, for instance, are made in safe and healthy working conditions. Both the farmers and producers receive a fair price and have a voice in how their workplace is run. â€œNatural,â€ on the other hand, doesnâ€™t necessarily hold up to what consumers may assume. While these products donâ€™t contain artificial ingredients or added colour and are minimally processed, growth hormones can still be used, theyâ€™re not always organic, and they donâ€™t require that animals are raised in open space, either.

            "Vladimir Putin might have popularized the shirtless-on-horseback calendar pose that was echoed recently by Alex Jones , but Jesse Jackson deserves credit for at least one thing: he chose to keep his shirt on Wednesday when he rode up to the front lines of a protest against the Dakota Access Pipeline. \n",

The Seattle Times reports that the administration asked Energy Transfer Partners for a second time Tuesday to voluntarily cease construction, to no avail. And Hillary? No oneâ€™s even sure yet where she really stands on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, but a few of Ruffaloâ€™s fans arenâ€™t happy that heâ€™s now with her, sort of. Please please please.

            "There are many things wrong with the educational system in America, and this story is evidence of a big one. A teacher in Wisconsin sued the city of Janesville after she showed up to a field trip drunk. She claimed that she was emotionally distressed after the police released her blood alcohol level test results. \n",
            "Fox News reported : \n",
            "A former elementary school teacher who passed out after showing up drunk to a bowling alley field trip is getting a $75,000 settlement from the Wisconsin city she sued. \n",
            "The ex-teacher, Maria Caya, filed a $5.5 million lawsuit against the city of Janesville last year claiming police improperly released her blood alcohol tests, Fox 6 reported . The city council approved the settlement Monday night. \n",
            "Investigators said her blood alcohol percentage was 0.27 percent on the day of the field trip in June 2013. The legal limit for driving in Wisconsin is 0.08 percent. \n",
            "Another staff member took Caya to the hospital after finding her passed out in the bowling alley bathroom, WKOW reported . As many as eight other adults were chaperoning the group of 4th graders. \n",
            "Aside from the teacherâ€™s $75,000 settlement, she also received $18,000 to resign because district officials noted that it would have cost more in legal fees to actually fire her. \n",
            "For that you can thank the teachersâ€™ unions, who have a stranglehold on the American educational system. Forget protecting the kids, letâ€™s make it difficult for the school district to fire a teacher who allegedly passed out drunk on a field trip. \n",
            "Fox News reported that despite the settlement, itâ€™s not clear whether or not she actually broke any laws. \n",
            "Jens Jorgensen, one of seven Janesville City Council members who opposed the settlement, told Fox 6: â€œI think that thereâ€™s a lot of things that happened that day and I would think that a judge and jury of her peers would be able to see through all of that and make the correct decision on that.â€ \n",
            "Christine Nimmo, a parent, said of the situation: â€œShe put our children in jeopardy.â€ \n",
            "If Maya did what she is alleged to have done, then she absolutely put the children in jeopardy, and this story is a prime example of why our schools are failing. Thanks to the teachersâ€™ unions, bad teachers stick around because schools are afraid of expensive legal action. \n",

            "As Global News reports: â€œThe jury ruling ended the trial that began Sept. 26 in the case brought by Deborah Giannecchini of Modesto, California. She was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2012. The suit accused Johnson & Johnson of â€œnegligent conductâ€ in making and marketing its baby powder.â€ \n",
            "Unfortunately, a statement from Carol Goodrich, a spokeswoman with Johnson & Johnson, said in the statement to Global: â€œWe deeply sympathize with the woman and families impacted by ovarian cancerâ€¦We will appeal todayâ€™s verdict because we are guided by the science, which supports the safety of Johnsonâ€™s Baby Powder.â€ advertisement - learn more Obviously, if these are the decisions being made by a court of law, there is ample amounts of science and evidence suggesting the baby powder was indeed the cause. Earlier in the year, a decision was made last by a Missouri state jury that awarded the family of Jacqueline Fox $10-million of actual damages and $62 million of punitive damages. In this case, we saw the exact same response from the company as the case noted above. These cases show how people are using something they thought was perfectly safe, but clearly wasnâ€™t. One of the most painful revelations, as Bloomberg notes, is that: In the 1990s, even as the company acknowledged concerns in the health community, it considered increasing its marketing efforts to black and Hispanic women, who were already buying the product in high numbers. Fox was black. The jury foreman, Krista Smith, says internal documents provided the most incriminating evidence: â€˜It was really clear they were hiding something.â€™ She wanted to award the Fox family even more. Imerys Talc America, the biggest talc supplier in the country and the sole source of the powder for J&J, was also named as a defendant. The company wasnâ€™t found liable. The â€˜scientific evidenceâ€™ to which she refers clearly have not withstood the scrutiny of either this trial or concerned members of the public; it also fails to account for who funded the research. Her remark also makes plain a disturbing trend amongst big corporations, which is the blind trust of their employees. Many clearly believe what they are told about the products they represent, without questioning or doing their own independent research. Scientific fraud induced by major corporations in this field is no secret, and various medical experts around the world have been speaking out against it for decades. Dr. Richard Horton, current Editor-in-Chief of The Lancet , one of the largest medical journals in the world, has publicly and unequivocally called out the scientific community for this negligence and outright fraud: The case against science is straightforward: much of the scientific literature, perhaps half, may simply be untrue. Afflicted by studies with small sample sizes, tiny effects, invalid exploratory analyses, and flagrant conflicts of interest, together with an obsession for pursuing fashionable trends of dubious importance, science has taken a turn towards darkness. ( source ) The sheer volume of statements from very credible people, along with the documents and evidence, attesting to this disturbing trend, is simply overwhelming. (You can find more information and view more examples/statements in an article we recently published about anti-depressant drugs here .) Yet the unfortunate reality is that employees of these big corporations stand behind their products, working under the assurances of corporately-funded science which, obviously, has profit in mind rather than safety. This is a widespread and alarming problem, and itâ€™s great to see more people raise their voice against these shady practices. Dr. Marcia Angell, a physician and longtime Editor-in-Chief of the New England Medical Journal (NEMJ), is another such professional to do so: It is simply no longer possible to believe much of the clinical research that is published, or to rely on the judgment of trusted physicians or authoritative medical guidelines. I take no pleasure in this conclusion, which I reached slowly and reluctantly over my two decades as an editor of the New England Journal of Medicine. ( source ) Itâ€™s no secret that many household products are toxic to our health. Science has been confirming their dangers for years now (not that many of us needed this confirmation); these products are literally littered with a number of hazardous harmful chemicals. Researchers in the UK, for example, found that domestic products such as anti-insect sprays, deodorants, cleaning products, cosmetics, and more contain a number of cancer causing chemicals. The researchers, from the Royal College of Physicians and the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, who concluded that these types of everyday household products maybe be contributing to 100,000 deaths every single year in Europe, warn that the public remains unaware of these risks. Another example of an insider speaking out against the industry is Foster Gamble, the direct descendant of one of the founders of Procter & Gamble (a company similar to Johnson & Johnson). He himself explains that he was groomed for the establishment, but his ethical concerns prompted him to change direction. To the left you will see a picture of him with Gerald Ford. Foster decided to leave the business and instead raise awareness about many issues, including the hazards associated with everyday household products that the corporations like his fatherâ€™s manufacture. Heâ€™s had an interesting life to say the least, and you can watch a documentary he released a few years ago here . \n",
